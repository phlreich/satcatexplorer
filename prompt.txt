TABLE satcat_orbitdata (
object_name,
norad_cat_id,
object_type, PAY = Payload; R/B = Rocket body; DEB = Other debris; UNK = Unknown
owner, (meaning the proper name of the country or organization like "United States")
launch_date,
launch_site,
period,
apogee,
perigee,
rcs,
epoch,
mean_motion,
eccentricity,
inclination,
ra_of_asc_node,
arg_of_pericenter,
mean_anomaly,
rev_at_epoch,
bstar)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- RETURN ONLY NORAD_CAT_ID
- ASSUME AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
- USE ILIKE '%SEARCHTERM%' FOR OBJECT AND COUNTRY NAMES
- REASON ABOUT THE QUERIES: IS "CHINESE" AN ACTUAL DATABASE ENTRY OR WOULD THAT USER REQUEST BE BETTER SERVED TO SEARCH FOR "CHINA" INSTEAD?
